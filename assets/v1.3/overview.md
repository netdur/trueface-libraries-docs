## Trueface SDK (Software Development Kit)

Welcome! The Trueface SDK is the unified base for all of our products. Written in C++, the SDK is self-contained and dependency free, it has the ability to run completely offline, supports both CPU and GPU deployment, and supports lazy initialization to minimize runtime memory usage.

Our SDK has been compiled as a static library and optimized to run on all major architectures and targets which include x86, Arm32, AArch64, CUDA, and is compatible with most operating systems including Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, and iOS. The SDK supports high-accuracy heavy models as well as more lightweight models for embedded deployments. The Trueface SDK currently supports additional language bindings including Python, Node.js, and Java (Android). Check out our Trueface SDK implementation in C++ and Python using the following links.

- [Trueface SDK Python Reference](https://reference.trueface.ai/cpp/master/latest/py/index.html)

C++ and Python are first class languages in Trueface, features, enhancments and bug fixes are introduced to C++ and Python first.

We would like to demonstrate the power of the Trueface Simple Home Face Recognition Access with the following video;
