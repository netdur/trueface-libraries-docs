# FaceDetectionMode

## `public enum FaceDetectionMode`

Face detection modes

## `ROBUST,`

The ROBUST mode is optimized for face recognition, smallestFaceHeight less than 80 pixels will be overridden.

## `VERSATILE`

The VERSATILE mode can detect small faces (as small as 16x16 pixel) and can be faster than the ROBUST mode.
