## Trueface SDK (Software Development Kit) for Mobile and Bindings

Welcome! The Trueface SDK serves as the foundation for all our products, offering an extensive range of features and capabilities designed specifically for mobile platforms (iOS and Android) as well as additional bindings like C. Developed in C++, the SDK boasts a self-contained, dependency-free architecture, allowing it to run entirely offline. With support for both CPU and GPU deployment, the SDK is engineered to minimize runtime memory usage through lazy initialization.

The SDK has been meticulously compiled as a static library, optimized to function seamlessly on a variety of architectures and targets, including x86, Arm32, AArch64, and CUDA. It is compatible with a wide array of operating systems such as Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, and iOS. Catering to diverse needs, the Trueface SDK offers both high-accuracy heavy models and lightweight models suitable for embedded deployments.

In addition to its core C++ and Python offerings, the Trueface SDK extends support to language bindings for Node.js, Java (Android), and mobile platforms. As prioritized languages at Trueface, C++ and Python receive the latest features, enhancements, and bug fixes before any other languages.

The C and mobile libraries have been specifically tailored as language bindings of the Trueface SDK, adapted to suit the unique form factors and requirements of various platforms. Our mobile-focused SDK empowers developers to create cutting-edge applications, harnessing the full potential of Trueface's AI models on iOS and Android devices.

As we continue to expand the scope of our SDK, we are committed to providing comprehensive support and resources for developers working with different languages and platforms. The Trueface SDK's flexibility, versatility, and ease of integration make it an indispensable tool for a wide range of applications, from large-scale enterprise solutions to compact embedded systems.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates and developments in our Trueface SDK for mobile platforms and language bindings, as we strive to bring the power of Trueface's AI technology to an even wider array of devices and applications.
