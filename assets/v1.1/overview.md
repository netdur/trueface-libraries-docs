## Trueface SDK
The Trueface SDK is the unified base for all of our products. Written in C++, the SDK is self-contained and dependency free, runs completely offline, supports both CPU and GPU deployment, and supports lazy initialization to minimize runtime memory usage. The SDK has been compiled as a static library and optimized to run on all major architectures and targets including x86, Arm32, AArch64, CUDA, and is compatible with most operating systems including Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS. The SDK supports high-accuracy heavy models as well as more lightweight models for embedded deployments. The SDK currently supports additional language bindings including Python, Node.js, and Java (Android).
